# Hey there, I'm Ireland ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at University of Victoria, currently diving deeper into full-stack development, data analytics, and how tech can actually make people's lives better.

- ðŸ“š Learning SQL and Power BI to level up my data skills
- ðŸ§ª Building projects with Python (and occasionally Java)
- ðŸŽ¨ Playing with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for my portfolio
- ðŸ§  Working on a Human-Computer Interaction project focused on how technology can support real community needs

## ðŸ›  Tech Iâ€™ve been using
- **Languages:** Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
